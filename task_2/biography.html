            <h3>Thomas Shelby Biography</h3>
            <p>Thomas Michael Shelby was born in Birmingham, England, around 1890 to an Irish Traveller and Romani family and grew up in the 
                Small Heath neighbourhood of Birmingham. He dated Greta Jurossi, a woman of Italian descent during his 20s, but she died of 
                tuberculosis. His experiences as a sergeant major during the First World War have resulted in him suffering from PTSD and it is
                implied he returned from it as a changed man.Thomas served in World War I with the rank of Sergeant Major and was decorated for 
                bravery (Though he dumped them in a canal after returning from the war). His experiences in World War I left him disillusioned and 
                beset with ongoing nightmares, and he becomes determined to move his family up in the world so that the powers who had always 
                mistreated them could no longer touch them.After the vendetta with the New York Mafia, and during the year of the Wall Street 
                Crash, Thomas Shelby became a Member of Parliament as a member of the Labour Party, while lending the chair of the legal business 
                to his older brother, Arthur Shelby.</p>
